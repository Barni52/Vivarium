// else becomes inline content. Nothing is copied, /clip is never written to (it
// keeps serving pty agent sessions and retires whenever that type does), and no
// mount is ever changed — which matters, because mounts may only change while
// the container is stopped, so "just add a mount" was never a cheap answer.
//
// Both halves were probed and both work: a native `image` block goes over the
// transport with no file, no mount and no path and lands in the transcript
// inline as base64, and a `Read` of a path outside /workspace raises no
// permission prompt in bypass. So the host↔container boundary is optional, not
// forced.
