# Releasing Vivarium

Seven steps, in order. Steps 1–4 must run **on the Windows host** — the dev container has no
electron-builder toolchain and cannot produce an NSIS installer. Say so rather than faking it.

## 1. Decide the version

Every release so far has been a minor bump (`0.1.0` → `0.6.0`), because the app has no external
users and no stability promise to break. Read `git log --oneline <lasttag>..HEAD` and pick:
minor for anything user-visible, patch only for a hotfix on top of a release.

## 2. Typecheck

```
npm run typecheck
```

There is no test suite by design, so this is the whole automated gate. Do not add one.

## 3. Bump the version

```
npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version
```

`--no-git-tag-version` because the tag is created in step 6, annotated, after the build proves
the version actually builds. electron-builder derives the installer filename from
`package.json` (`artifactName: ${productName}-${version}-setup.${ext}`), so the bump must land
*before* the build or the artifact carries the old number.

Expect `tsconfig.*.tsbuildinfo` in the diff alongside `package.json` / `package-lock.json` —
they are tracked in this repo. Commit them.

## 4. Release commit

Subject: `vX.Y: <two or three headline topics, lowercase, comma-separated>`

Body: `Release build of everything since vX.Y-1 (<sha>..<sha>): <one sentence listing what
shipped>.` Include the actual commit range — it is how a later reader maps a release to its
work without trusting the notes.

## 5. Build the installer

```
npm run build:win
```

Produces `dist/Vivarium-<version>-setup.exe` (~83 MB) plus a blockmap. Check the filename
carries the new version; if it doesn't, step 3 didn't land.

## 6. Annotated tag

```
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -F -   # message: the version on line 1, blank line, one paragraph of scope
git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Always annotated, never lightweight — the tag message is a second, terser copy of the release
scope that survives independently of GitHub.

## 7. GitHub release

Draft the notes into `dist/RELEASE-<version>.md` (`dist/` is gitignored, so the draft is
scratch — the published release is the copy of record), then:

```
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file dist/RELEASE-<version>.md \
  "dist/Vivarium-<version>-setup.exe#Vivarium-<version>-setup.exe"
```

Verify the asset actually uploaded — an 83 MB upload can fail long after the release exists:

```
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json assets --jq '[.assets[]|{name,size,state}]'
```

`state` must read `uploaded`.

## Release-notes style

This is the part worth getting right; the rest is mechanical. Read the previous release
(`gh release view <lasttag>`) before writing, and match it.

- `## Vivarium vX.Y` heading, then one `###` section per substantial change, ordered by how
  much it changes daily use. Fixes collect in a single `### Fixes` list at the end.
- **Lead with the symptom, not the change.** "An agent that finished planning sat there showing
  a climbing timer" before "both tools now report through the bridge". The reader recognises
  the symptom; they have never heard of the bridge.
- Explain the *why* and the constraint, in prose, at the density the codebase comments use —
  the WSL clock drift, the capture-phase listener, the 3-second probe. These notes double as
  the public record of decisions this repo's comments make internally.
- Say what was traded away, not only what was gained (Ctrl+F taking the chord from readline).
- Bold the sentence a skimmer needs. Do not bold whole paragraphs.
- Close with `---` and `**Install:** download \`Vivarium-<version>-setup.exe\` below and run it
  (Windows, NSIS installer).`

Write the notes from the commit bodies, which are long and explanatory in this repo — they are
the source material, not `--oneline`.

## What this does not cover

The build passing is not the app working. Nothing here launches the installer, and the CDP
smoke run in CLAUDE.md exercises the dev build, not the packaged one. If the release was not
manually installed and opened, say that plainly rather than reporting it as verified.
